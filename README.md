Nambili Samuel was born in Oshikango, Namibia, into a family descended from the [Ongandjera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ongandjera) royal lineage. As a young boy, he grew up surrounded by people who always encouraged him to strive for greatness. He is a trained soldier and medical physician by profession, with extensive experience in public healthcare and national security. One of Nambili Samuel's most defining experiences was his military training. As a patriot, he was drawn to the idea of serving the Motherland, [Namibia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia), and protecting her people. Nambili underwent rigorous training at [Osona Military School](https://www.google.com/search?q=at+Osona+military+School&oq=at+Osona+military+School&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCTE0MDE1ajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), which instilled in him discipline and a sense of duty.

It was during this transition from civilian life to the military that he developed a strong commitment and specialized medicine as a professional military career. The military groomed him and taught him the values of discipline, teamwork, and leadership. Through basic military training, he learned the importance of working diligently toward a target goal.

He underwent rigorous training at Osona Military School, specializing in medicine. Throughout his 19 years in the Namibian Defence Force (NDF), Nambili gained expertise in various specialties, including intelligence, criminal justice, and medicine. Much of his military work remains classified, in the interest of national security. As an expert in scientific writing, and computer programming, his work has significantly contributed to various scientific workshops collaborating with reputable global institutions, such as IBM, and the World Health Organization (WHO), to name but a few.

His military experience has been a defining moment in his life, instilling in him valuable life lessons that he continues to apply in his everyday life. It also helped him become a disciplined, mature person and a more patriotic citizen. Throughout his service in the [Namibian Defence Force (NDF)](https://modva.gov.na), Nambili has demonstrated proficiency in emergency medicine, evacuation ['CASEVAC'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualty_evacuation), primary health care, and [pharmacology](https://www.ualberta.ca/pharmacology/about/what-is-pharmacology.html). As a combat medic, he was deployed at several military hospitals at **Army Battle School** in Oshivelo, Grootfontein Military Hospital, and **Peter Mweshihange Military Hospital** in Windhoek—to provide medical support to fellow service members in the force. Some of his responsibilities included:

- Administering emergency medical treatment and dispensing medications to armed forces personnel.
- Observing medical procedures, managing patient referrals, and coordinating evacuations.
- Providing primary care services in sick bays, administering immunizations, and ensuring hygiene standards.
- Conducting medical assessments and providing care for illnesses and injuries.
- Assisting with medical testing during training, including conducting physical exams and health screenings.
- Collaborating with healthcare providers in civilian settings to ensure the continuity of proper medical follow-ups.
- Coordinating a preventative HIV/AIDS program under [PEPFAR](https://na.usembassy.gov/our-relationship/pepfar/)’s pandemic control.

Nambili is a dedicated professional with extensive experience in cyber warfare and intelligence. Throughout his service, he has demonstrated exceptional proficiency, making significant contributions to mission success and the well-being of his fellow service members. In addition to his primary duties, Nambili plays a crucial role in providing general medical care and supporting the well-being of personnel at the Oshivelo Military Battle School under his jurisdiction.
